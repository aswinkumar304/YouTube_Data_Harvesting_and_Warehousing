# Project Title : YouTube Data Harvesting and  Warehousing

# Skills Take Away From This Project : Python scripting, Data Collection, MongoDB, Streamlit, API integration, Data Management using MongoDB (Atlas) and SQL.

# Project Description : Developed a Youtube Data analysis application using Python,MongoDB,SQL, and Streamlit, integrating Google API for efficient data retrievel,storage and analysis.

Set up a Streamlit App: Create a Streamlit application with a user interface allowing input of YouTube channel IDs.
Connect to the YouTube API: Use the Google API client library to make requests to the YouTube API, retrieving channel details and video information based on the provided channel ID.
Store Data in MongoDB Data Lake: Implement functionality to store the retrieved YouTube data (channel name, subscribers, video details) in a MongoDB database, treating it as a data lake.
Collect Data for Multiple Channels: Add a button in the Streamlit app to allow users to collect data for up to 10 different YouTube channels and store them in the MongoDB data lake.
Migrate Data to SQL Data Warehouse: Develop a process to migrate data from the MongoDB data lake to a PostgreSQL data warehouse  for structured storage.
Query SQL Data Warehouse: Utilize SQL queries, possibly with a Python SQL library like SQLAlchemy, to join tables in the SQL data warehouse and retrieve channel-specific data based on user input.
Display Data in Streamlit App: Implement features in the Streamlit app to display the queried data, incorporating Streamlit's data visualization capabilities such as charts and graphs.
