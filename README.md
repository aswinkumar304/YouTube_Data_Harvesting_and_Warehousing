# Project Title : YouTube Data Harvesting and  Warehousing

# Skills Take Away From This Project : Python scripting, Data Collection, MongoDB, Streamlit, API integration, Data Management using MongoDB (Atlas) and SQL.

# Project Description : Developed a Youtube Data analysis application using Python,MongoDB,SQL, and Streamlit, integrating Google API for efficient data retrievel,storage and analysis.

# steps:
# Step 1 : Connect to the YouTube API: Use the Google API client library to make requests to the YouTube API, retrieving channel details and video information based on the provided channel ID.
# Step 2 : Store Data in MongoDB Data Lake: Implement functionality to store the retrieved YouTube data (channel name, subscribers, video details) in a MongoDB database, treating it as a data lake.
# Step 3 : Migrate Data to SQL Data Warehouse: Develop a process to migrate data from the MongoDB data lake to a PostgreSQL data warehouse  for structured storage.
# Step 4 : Set up a Streamlit App: Create a Streamlit application with a user interface allowing input of YouTube channel IDs.
# Step 5 : Display Data in Streamlit App: Implement features in the Streamlit app to display the queried data, incorporating Streamlit's data visualization capabilities such as charts and graphs.
